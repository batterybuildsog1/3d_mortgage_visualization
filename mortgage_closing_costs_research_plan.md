- [x] Flood Certification Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee per property assessment
  - **Base Formula**: Flat fee of $15 to $50
  - **State Variations**:
    - Minimal state variations as this is a standardized service
    - Slightly higher fees ($5-$10 more) may apply in high-flood-risk states (Florida, Louisiana, Texas)
  - **Optional Life-of-Loan Coverage**: Additional $5-$20 for monitoring throughout the loan term
  - **Notes**: Flood certification is required by lenders to determine if a property is located in a FEMA-designated flood zone. If the property is in a flood zone, flood insurance will be required, which is a separate and more substantial cost. The certification fee itself is relatively small and standardized since it's primarily a database lookup service. Most lenders require "life of loan" flood tracking services, which monitor flood map changes over time. This is a one-time fee paid at closing. Some lenders include this as part of their origination fee package rather than as a separate line item.- [x] Real Estate Agent Commission
  - **Representative Equation**: Commission based on home sale price
  - **Base Formula**: 5-6% of home sale price, typically split between listing agent and buyer's agent
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Commission Markets** (Rural areas, low-price markets): Closer to 6%
    - **Moderate-Commission Markets** (Suburban areas, mid-price markets): Typically 5-5.5%
    - **Low-Commission Markets** (Urban areas, high-price markets): May drop to 4.5-5%
  - **Recent Changes**: Due to recent regulatory changes (as of 2024), commission structures have shifted, with more buyers required to pay their agent's commission directly.
  - **Notes**: While traditionally paid by the seller, commission structures are changing due to recent legal settlements in the real estate industry. Buyers may increasingly need to pay their agent's commission directly, which would make this a buyer closing cost in some transactions. Commission rates are always negotiable, regardless of local custom. Discount brokerages may offer lower commission rates (1-2% listing fee). For higher-priced homes, agents may be more willing to accept a lower percentage commission. While these fees have traditionally not appeared on buyer closing cost worksheets, buyers should be aware of them as market practices evolve.- [x] HOA Transfer Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Fee for transferring HOA membership records
  - **Base Formula**: Flat fee ranging from $200 to $500 depending on HOA
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-HOA States** (Florida, California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas): Higher end of range, typically $300-$800
    - **Moderate-HOA States** (Colorado, Washington, Virginia, North Carolina, Illinois): Mid-range, typically $200-$400
    - **Low-HOA States** (All other states): Lower end of range, typically $100-$300
  - **Additional Costs**: Document package fees ($100-$300), move-in fees ($100-$500), capital contribution fees (1-3 months of HOA dues)
  - **Notes**: HOA transfer fees only apply to properties within homeowners associations (condos, townhomes, and some single-family home communities). The fee covers administrative costs of transferring ownership records within the HOA. Additional HOA-related closing costs may include document fees (for providing HOA documents to the buyer), move-in fees, and capital contribution fees. These fees vary dramatically based on the individual HOA rather than just geography. In some states, there are legal caps on HOA transfer fees. Payment responsibility (buyer vs. seller) is negotiable and often dictated by local custom.- [x] Escrow/Impound Account Setup
  - **Representative Equation**: Fee for establishing escrow account
  - **Base Formula**: Flat fee of $50 to $75
  - **State Variations**:
    - **Escrow-Required States** (states with laws requiring escrow accounts for certain loans): Base formula (regulatory requirement)
    - **Escrow-Optional States**: Base formula or $0 (competitively driven)
  - **Lender Variations**: Many national lenders charge $0 for escrow setup as a competitive practice, while some regional banks still charge setup fees.
  - **Notes**: Escrow/impound setup fees are becoming less common as the mortgage market becomes more competitive. Many lenders have eliminated this fee entirely. The fee should not be confused with the actual funds collected for the escrow account (property tax reserves and insurance premiums), which are separate items. Federal regulations limit the maximum "cushion" lenders can require to two months' worth of payments. Some lenders charge a fee (typically $250-$500) to waive escrow requirements for qualified borrowers, which is separate from the escrow setup fee. Borrowers with less than 20% down payment are typically required to establish an escrow account.- [x] Property Tax Reserves
  - **Representative Equation**: Prepaid property taxes plus escrow cushion
  - **Base Formula**: (Annual Property Tax ÷ 12) × Number of Months Until Next Tax Bill Due + 2 Month Escrow Cushion
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Tax States** (New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont): Effective tax rates of 1.5% to 2.5% of property value annually
    - **Moderate-Tax States** (Texas, Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania): Effective tax rates of 0.9% to 1.5% of property value annually
    - **Low-Tax States** (Hawaii, Alabama, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming): Effective tax rates of 0.3% to 0.8% of property value annually
  - **Timing Impact**: The month of closing significantly impacts reserves required - closing just after tax bills are due results in lower initial reserves.
  - **Notes**: Property tax reserves are funds collected at closing to establish an escrow account for future tax payments. The amount collected depends on when property taxes are next due in that location. Some areas collect taxes annually, others semi-annually or quarterly. In high-tax states, property tax reserves can be one of the largest closing cost items. Some borrowers with down payments of 20% or more can waive escrow requirements (paying insurance and taxes themselves), though lenders may charge a fee for this option. Property taxes vary dramatically not just by state but by county and municipality.- [x] Homeowners Insurance Premium
  - **Representative Equation**: Annual premium based on home value, construction, and location risk factors
  - **Base Formula**: For a $300,000 home, set annual premium at $1,200. Scale linearly with home value (e.g., $2,400 for a $600,000 home).
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas): Base formula premium + 75% to 150% (higher natural disaster risk)
    - **Moderate-Cost States** (California, New York, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina): Base formula premium + 15% to 40%
    - **Low-Cost States** (Utah, Idaho, Wisconsin, Vermont, Ohio): Base formula premium - 10% to 30%
  - **Prepayment Requirements**: Typically, lenders require 12 months of insurance paid at closing plus 2 months for the initial escrow cushion.
  - **Notes**: Homeowners insurance costs vary dramatically based on location-specific risks (hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, flooding), home construction type, credit score, claims history, and coverage levels. While not technically a closing cost, the first year's premium plus additional months for escrow are collected at closing when using a mortgage. Borrowers are typically required to prepay 12-14 months of premiums at closing. Flood insurance, if required, would be an additional premium not included in standard homeowners insurance. Some high-value homes may require specialized insurance products at higher rates.- [x] Prepaid Interest
  - **Representative Equation**: Interest from closing date to end of month
  - **Base Formula**: (Loan Amount × Annual Interest Rate ÷ 365) × Number of Days from Closing to End of Month
  - **State Variations**: 
    - No significant state variations as this is based on mathematical calculation
  - **Timing Impact**: Closing at the end of the month results in less prepaid interest due at closing. Closing at the beginning of the month results in more prepaid interest.
  - **Notes**: Prepaid interest covers the interest accrued from your closing date until the end of that month. After that, your regular mortgage payment schedule begins, typically with the first payment due on the 1st of the month after the first full month of ownership. For example, if you close on January 15th, you'll pay interest for January 15-31 at closing, and your first full mortgage payment will be due March 1st, covering February's interest. This amount varies solely based on closing date, loan amount, and interest rate—not geography. Prepaid interest is generally tax-deductible in the year paid.- [x] Discount Points
  - **Representative Equation**: Optional fee to reduce interest rate
  - **Base Formula**: Each discount point costs 1% of the loan amount and typically reduces the interest rate by 0.25%. 
  - **State Variations**: 
    - Discount points do not vary by state as they are lender specific and tied to market interest rates
  - **Typical Benefit Formula**: For each point paid (1% of loan amount), reduce interest rate by 0.25%. For fractional points, apply proportional reduction (e.g., 0.5 points reduces rate by approximately 0.125%).
  - **Breakeven Calculation**: Breakeven period (in months) = Points cost / Monthly savings from reduced interest
  - **Notes**: Discount points are entirely optional and represent prepaid interest to secure a lower rate over the life of the loan. They're most beneficial for borrowers who plan to keep their mortgage for a long period. The interest rate reduction per point varies by lender and market conditions, typically ranging from 0.125% to 0.375% per point. Points are tax-deductible in the year paid for most borrowers who itemize deductions. The value of each point increases as loan amounts increase, making them potentially more cost-effective for larger loans. Points can sometimes be negotiated as part of the overall loan package.- [x] Transfer Tax
  - **Representative Equation**: Tax based on purchase price or property value
  - **Base Formula**: For states with moderate transfer taxes, calculate as 0.1% of the purchase price (or $1 per $1,000).
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Tax States** (Delaware, Washington, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C.): 1.0% to 4.0% of purchase price
    - **Moderate-Tax States** (California, Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Maryland): 0.1% to 0.7% of purchase price
    - **Low-Tax States** (Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas): 0.01% to 0.1% of purchase price
    - **No-Tax States** (Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Wyoming): $0
  - **Regional Payment Customs**:
    - **Seller-Pays States**: California, Nevada, Washington, Arizona
    - **Buyer-Pays States**: Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania
    - **Split States**: New York, Florida, Illinois, Michigan
  - **Notes**: Transfer taxes may be imposed at the state, county, and/or municipal levels, resulting in wide variations even within states. Some localities offer exemptions for first-time homebuyers, low-income buyers, or primary residences. In some areas, transfer taxes increase progressively with property value (tiered structure). In "split" states, the tax burden is typically divided between buyer and seller based on local custom, but this is negotiable. Some states call this a "deed tax," "stamp tax," or "documentary stamp tax."- [x] Recording Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Fee based on document count and page count
  - **Base Formula**: Base recording fee of $120 for standard mortgage package (deed, mortgage/deed of trust) with first 5 pages included. Add $5 per additional page.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost Counties** (primarily in California, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Illinois): Base formula fee + $100
    - **Low-Cost Counties** (primarily in Missouri, Kentucky, Alabama, Arkansas, South Dakota): Base formula fee - $50
    - **Medium-Cost Counties** (all other counties): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Recording fees are set by county governments, not states, resulting in significant variation even within states. These fees pay for the county recorder's office to record the deed and mortgage documents in public land records. Some counties charge flat fees per document while others charge based on page count. In some areas, electronic recording (e-recording) may offer reduced fees. Recording fees are typically non-negotiable as they are government-mandated. Some counties add additional fees for specific local programs (e.g., affordable housing initiatives).- [x] Owner's Title Insurance
  - **Representative Equation**: Insurance premium based on purchase price
  - **Base Formula**: For purchase prices up to $100,000, set premium at $850. For purchase prices from $100,001 to $250,000, set premium at $1,200. For every additional $100,000 in purchase price, add $200 to the premium.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (California, New York, Colorado, Washington, Alaska): Base formula premium + 25%
    - **Low-Cost States** (Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota): Base formula premium - 25%
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Regional Payment Customs**:
    - **Seller-Pays States** (California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, DC): Seller traditionally pays this fee
    - **Buyer-Pays States** (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington): Buyer traditionally pays this fee
    - **Split States** (All other states): Negotiable or customarily split
  - **Notes**: Owner's title insurance is optional but strongly recommended as it protects the buyer's equity in the property. Unlike lender's title insurance, owner's title insurance provides lifetime coverage as long as the insured or their heirs own the property. Premium costs can be significantly reduced through "simultaneous issue" discounts when purchased alongside lender's title insurance. In Iowa, the state-run title guaranty program replaces traditional owner's title insurance and costs substantially less. Many title companies offer enhanced coverage options for an additional 10-20% premium.- [x] Lender's Title Insurance
  - **Representative Equation**: Insurance premium based on loan amount
  - **Base Formula**: For loan amounts up to $100,000, set premium at $550. For loan amounts from $100,001 to $250,000, set premium at $750. For every additional $100,000 in loan amount, add $100 to the premium.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (California, New York, Colorado, Washington, Alaska): Base formula premium + 30%
    - **Low-Cost States** (Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota): Base formula premium - 20%
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Lender's title insurance is required by almost all mortgage lenders to protect their interest in the property. The premium is a one-time payment that provides coverage for the term of the loan. In some states (e.g., Florida, New Mexico), title insurance premiums are regulated and standardized across all providers. In "simultaneous issue" states, borrowers receive a substantial discount when purchasing owner's title insurance and lender's title insurance at the same time. Refinance transactions often qualify for "reissue rates" that can be 25-40% lower than standard rates if the previous policy is recent.- [x] Title Search/Examination
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee with potential adjustments for complexity
  - **Base Formula**: Set title search/examination fee at $400 for standard residential properties. Add $100 for properties with complex ownership history (e.g., foreclosures, multiple previous owners within 5 years).
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (California, New York, Washington D.C., Hawaii, Connecticut): Base formula + $150
    - **Low-Cost States** (Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Iowa): Base formula - $100
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Title search fees cover the cost of researching public records to verify the property's ownership history and ensuring there are no liens, judgments, or other encumbrances on the property. In some states, especially those requiring attorneys for closings, the title search may be included in attorney fees. Properties with complex ownership histories or in counties with poor record-keeping systems may incur additional fees. Iowa is unique because it has a state-run title guaranty program that often results in lower title-related costs.- [x] Escrow/Closing Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Fee based on purchase price and regional practices
  - **Base Formula**: For purchase prices up to $250,000, set escrow/closing fee at $400. For every additional $100,000 in purchase price, add $50 to the fee, capped at $1,000.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (California, Washington, Hawaii, New York, Alaska): Base formula + $150 with a cap of $1,500
    - **Low-Cost States** (Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama): Base formula - $100 with a cap of $800
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Escrow/closing fees are charged by the escrow company or title company that handles the closing process. In some states, this service is provided by attorneys instead. These fees cover the administrative costs of handling the money and documents involved in closing. Fees are sometimes split between buyers and sellers, but this is negotiable. Some lenders have relationships with specific escrow companies and may offer discounted fees. In "attorney states," there may be both attorney fees and escrow fees, though the functions sometimes overlap.- [x] Attorney Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Fee based on transaction complexity and regional practices
  - **Base Formula**: For standard residential transactions, set attorney fee at $750 for purchase price up to $500,000. For properties over $500,000, add $150 for each additional $250,000 in purchase price.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **Attorney-Required States** (New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia, North Carolina): Base formula + $250 (these states typically require attorney involvement in real estate transactions)
    - **Attorney-Optional States with High Usage** (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire): Base formula + $100
    - **Attorney-Optional States with Low Usage** (All other states): Base formula - $150 or often $0 (as attorneys are rarely used in these markets)
  - **Notes**: Attorney fees vary significantly based on locale, property complexity, and whether attorney involvement is legally required or customary in that state. In states where attorneys aren't required, title companies often handle the closing. Fees can be hourly or flat-rate, with flat rates more common for residential transactions. Attorney fees may include document review, title examination, and closing representation. For complex transactions (e.g., commercial properties, unusual financing), fees increase substantially.- [x] Pest Inspection Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee based on property size and region
  - **Base Formula**: Standard pest inspection fee of $100 for properties up to 2,000 sq. ft. Add $25 for every additional 1,000 sq. ft.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Risk States** (Florida, California, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and other Southern/Coastal states): Base formula + $50 (due to higher termite risk)
    - **Low-Risk States** (Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Maine, Vermont, and other Northern states): Base formula - $25 (due to lower termite risk)
    - **Medium-Risk States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Pest inspections are often required for VA and FHA loans in many states. In high-termite-risk areas, this inspection is strongly recommended even when not required. Some mortgage lenders require pest inspections regardless of loan type in high-risk regions. The fee is typically paid at the time of inspection rather than at closing. In some markets, a pest inspection may be included as part of the general home inspection for an additional $50-$100.- [x] Home Inspection Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee based on property size and age
  - **Base Formula**: For homes under 2,000 sq. ft., set inspection fee at $350. For homes 2,000-3,000 sq. ft., set fee at $400. For every additional 1,000 sq. ft., add $50. For homes over 50 years old, add an additional $75.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, California, New York, Washington D.C., Massachusetts): Base formula + $100
    - **Low-Cost States** (Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia): Base formula - $75
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Home inspection fees are typically paid directly to the inspector and are not included in mortgage closing costs. However, they're an important consideration in the overall cost of purchasing a home. Additional specialized inspections (e.g., radon, mold, termite) will incur extra fees. Most inspectors offer package deals for multiple inspections. Unlike appraisals, home inspections are generally optional but highly recommended for buyers.- [x] Appraisal Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee based on property value and complexity
  - **Base Formula**: For purchase price bracket $100,000-$250,000, set appraisal fee at $500. For every $150,000 increase in purchase price, add $60 to the appraisal fee. Cap appraisal fee at $1,300.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, New York, California, Washington D.C., Alaska): For purchase price bracket $100,000-$250,000, set appraisal fee at $600. For every $150,000 increase in purchase price, add $85 to the appraisal fee. Cap appraisal fee at $1,600.
    - **Low-Cost States** (Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia): For purchase price bracket $100,000-$250,000, set appraisal fee at $425. For every $150,000 increase in purchase price, add $45 to the appraisal fee. Cap appraisal fee at $1,000.
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Appraisal fees are typically higher for luxury properties, rural properties, or unique homes that are difficult to value. Additional fees may apply for rush orders or complex appraisals. Some lenders allow borrowers to pay the appraisal fee upfront (before closing), while others roll it into closing costs. In some cases, the appraisal fee may be refunded if the loan doesn't close, but this varies by lender.- [x] Document Preparation Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee ranging from $150 to $500
  - **Base Formula**: For standard mortgage transactions, set document preparation fee at $250. For more complex transactions (e.g., investment properties, non-standard income documentation), set fee at $350.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, New York, California, Washington D.C.): Base formula + $75
    - **Low-Cost States** (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri): Base formula - $50
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Document preparation fees cover the cost of preparing the legal documents needed for closing. Some lenders bundle this into their origination or underwriting fees. In states that require attorney involvement in real estate transactions (such as New York, Massachusetts, and South Carolina), these fees may be higher or included as part of attorney fees. Some online lenders have lower document preparation fees due to automated processes.- [x] Credit Report Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee ranging from $25 to $100
  - **Base Formula**: For a single borrower, set credit report fee at $45. For each additional borrower (co-applicant), add $30.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, New York, California, Washington D.C.): Base formula + $15 per borrower
    - **Low-Cost States** (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri): Base formula - $5 per borrower
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Credit report fees typically cover the cost of obtaining credit reports from the three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion). This is often the only fee a lender can charge before providing a Loan Estimate. Some lenders may include this fee as part of their application fee or waive it entirely for competitive reasons. Credit report fees are generally consistent across the country with minor regional variations.- [x] Underwriting Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee ranging from $300 to $750
  - **Base Formula**: For loan amounts under $300,000, set underwriting fee at $400. For loan amounts between $300,000 and $500,000, set fee at $500. For loan amounts over $500,000, set fee at $600.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, New York, Delaware, California, Washington D.C.): Base formula + $100
    - **Low-Cost States** (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri): Base formula - $75
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Underwriting fees cover the cost of evaluating a borrower's creditworthiness and determining whether to approve the loan. Some lenders bundle this into the origination fee rather than charging it separately. These fees are typically higher for more complex loans (e.g., jumbo loans or loans with unusual income sources). Borrowers with excellent credit may be able to negotiate reduced underwriting fees.# Mortgage Closing Costs and Fees Research Plan

This document outlines a detailed research plan for determining representative equations for typical mortgage closing costs and fees across different states and regions.

## Research Methodology
For each fee category, we will:
1. Research typical costs across different states/regions
2. Identify cost drivers (purchase price, loan amount, etc.)
3. Create a representative equation for each fee
4. Determine variations for high-cost, middle-cost, and low-cost states
5. Document findings and mark each item as complete

## Fee Categories to Research

### Lender Fees
- [x] Loan Origination Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Loan Origination Fee = Loan Amount × (0.5% to 1.0%)
  - **Base Formula**: For loan amounts up to $300,000, set origination fee at 1.0% of loan amount. For every $100,000 increase in loan amount above $300,000, reduce the percentage by 0.1% to a minimum of 0.5%.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, New York, Delaware, California, Washington D.C.): Base formula with minimum 0.75% rate
    - **Low-Cost States** (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri): Base formula but cap at 0.8% for any loan amount
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Origination fees are negotiable, especially for borrowers with excellent credit scores (720+) and substantial down payments (20%+). Online lenders typically charge lower origination fees than traditional banks. Some lenders offer "no origination fee" loans but compensate with higher interest rates.

- [x] Application Fee
  - **Representative Equation**: Flat fee ranging from $0 to $500
  - **Base Formula**: For purchase prices under $300,000, set application fee at $350. For purchase prices over $300,000, set application fee at $400. For purchase prices over $600,000, set application fee at $450.
  - **State Variations**:
    - **High-Cost States** (Hawaii, New York, California, Washington D.C.): Base formula + $50
    - **Low-Cost States** (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Kentucky, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri): Base formula - $50
    - **Middle-Cost States** (All other states): Base formula
  - **Notes**: Application fees vary significantly between lenders and are often negotiable. Many online lenders don't charge application fees at all, and some traditional lenders waive this fee for existing customers. Some lenders bundle this fee into the origination fee. Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the only fee a lender can charge prior to providing a Loan Estimate is a credit report fee (typically less than $30).
