# Summary of Recent UI/UX Changes to Financial Snapshot (Intro Page)

Based on user feedback received on 2025-03-28, the following changes were implemented to the Financial Snapshot feature:

1.  **Trigger Timing:**
    *   **Change:** Modified `js/script-new.js` to trigger the Financial Snapshot modal automatically once on page load, immediately after essential page elements and the visualization controller are initialized.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the feedback that triggering on the "Calculate" button felt like a "bait and switch." Provides the DTI estimation upfront as intended.
    *   **Impact:** The original "Calculate Borrowing Power" button is now repurposed to "Recalculate" and triggers subsequent calculations using the main engine *after* the initial snapshot is complete. Input changes (sliders, loan types, text fields) also trigger recalculations directly after the initial snapshot.

2.  **Modal Styling:**
    *   **Change:** Updated `css/financial-snapshot.css` significantly to better align with the existing "neomort" theme defined in `styles.css`. This included adopting the dark background, cyberpunk accent colors (cyan, purple, pink), monospace font, border styles, input field appearance, and button gradients/styles.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses feedback that the modal styling looked out of place ("awful"). Creates a more cohesive user experience.

3.  **Liquid Assets Step (Wording & UI):**
    *   **Change:** Rewrote the introductory text and instructions in the "Liquid Assets" step (`js/financial-snapshot/steps.js`) for clarity.
    *   **Change:** Added a new "Estimated Closing Costs Breakdown" section within this step (`js/financial-snapshot/ui.js`, `steps.js`, `css/financial-snapshot.css`). This section calculates and displays estimated costs based on percentages of the purchase price goal and the down payment amount provided by the user.
    *   **Change:** Added a specific instruction field just before the radio options to clarify what the user should select.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses feedback that the previous wording was "awful" and unclear. Provides better context for why remaining liquid assets are important and what constitutes them.

4.  **Snapshot Summary Step:**
    *   **Change:** Added a new final "Summary" step to the modal flow (`js/financial-snapshot/steps.js`, `snapshot.js`, `ui.js`).
    *   **Change:** This step currently displays the single `estimatedMaxDTI` calculated based on the *initially selected* loan type before the user proceeds.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the feedback that "nothing happens" after filling out the form. Provides immediate feedback on the estimated DTI before showing the main calculator.

5.  **Calculation Flow:**
    *   **Change:** Refactored `js/script-new.js` to manage the application state (`snapshotCompleted`, `lastEstimatedDTI`) and ensure the main calculation (`VisualizationAdapter.updateVisualization`) only runs *after* the snapshot is completed (either initially or on subsequent user interactions).
    *   **Rationale:** Fixes the issue where the snapshot might restart or calculations might run prematurely. Ensures the estimated DTI is available for the main calculation display.
