# Mortgage Engine Rebuild - Progress Report (PRD v3.0 Implementation)

**Date:** 2025-03-28

**Status:** Phase 1 completed, Phase 2 initiated (paused for data update).

**Summary:**
This report details the progress made in rebuilding the mortgage calculation engine according to the specifications outlined in `PRD_v3_Mortgage_Engine_Enhancement.md` (Version 3.0). The primary focus has been on Phase 1 (Data Structure & Service Layer Enhancement) and incorporating updated closing cost research.

**Completed Tasks:**

1.  **PRD Saved:** The detailed PRD v3.0 document was saved as `PRD_v3_Mortgage_Engine_Enhancement.md` for reference.
2.  **Phase 1: Data Structure & Service Layer Enhancement**
    *   **JSDoc Definitions Updated:** Added `@typedef` definitions for `MortgageInput`, `ClosingCostDetails`, `ClosingCostsBreakdown`, and `CalculationResult` to `js/engine/calculator.js`, incorporating the new `overrides` structure and `trueAPR` placeholder as specified in PRD sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. Updated the `@param` and `@returns` documentation for the main `calculate` method.
    *   **Closing Costs Data File Created:** Created `data/closing_costs.json` as it did not previously exist. Populated it with initial common fees and included the `regZFinanceCharge` boolean flag required by PRD section 4.3.3 and Appendix 9.4.
    *   **Property Tax Data Updated:** Modified `data/location/property_tax.json` to include `taxCycle` information (frequency, due dates) for states, as required by PRD section 4.2.7. Added a default cycle and specific examples for CA, CO, and TX. Corrected a duplication error for the 'CO' entry.
3.  **Closing Cost Data Refinement (User Request):**
    *   Updated `data/closing_costs.json` extensively based on the detailed research provided in `mortgage_closing_costs_research_plan.md`. This involved:
        *   Refining calculation methods (e.g., adding tiered structures).
        *   Updating typical amounts and formulas.
        *   Adding new fees identified in the research (e.g., Application Fee, HOA Transfer Fee).
        *   Expanding state variation details based on the research findings.
        *   Ensuring JSON validity after updates.

**Current Status & Next Steps:**

*   Phase 1 is now complete.
*   Phase 2 (Closing Cost Engine & Override Logic) was initiated but paused to incorporate the closing cost research updates into the data file first.
*   **Next immediate step:** Resume Phase 2 by creating and implementing the `estimateAllCosts` and `calculateIndividualFee` functions within `js/engine/adjustments/closing-costs.js`, ensuring it utilizes the newly updated `data/closing_costs.json` and handles the override logic as defined in the PRD.

**Team Coordination Notes:**

*   The `data/closing_costs.json` file now reflects the latest research and PRD v3.0 requirements for fee structures and `regZFinanceCharge` flags.
*   The `data/location/property_tax.json` file includes tax cycle data needed for accurate prepaid tax calculations.
*   The core data structures (`MortgageInput`, `CalculationResult`) are defined via JSDoc in `js/engine/calculator.js`.
*   Development will now proceed with implementing the closing cost calculation logic in `js/engine/adjustments/closing-costs.js`.
